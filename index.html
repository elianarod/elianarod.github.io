                In a scenario where a significant disconnect exists between
                humans and nature, misunderstandings and misrepresentations may
                emerge, potentially creating a sense of distance. To bridge this
                gap, a machine was used as a mediator, merging two distinct
                datasets — typefaces from the Google Fonts Library and images of
                slime mold simulations. Through this process, an AI was trained
                to produce unrecognizable and new letters, revealing hidden
                elements in the latent space between humans and nature. Its
                visual performance is a result of curating, categorizing and
                sorting, offering the viewers new perceptions and reflections on
                the shapes of letters, emphasizing form and composition over
                readability. Can these symbols constitute an alternative
                language? Are they imaginary logotypes?

                HTML has proven to be stable and reliable over the years,
                forming the backbone of the World Wide Web. Reflecting on HTML’s
                timeless, reliable and accessible qualities, a collectively
                built website archives the things people want to preserve for
                the future. Exploring topics on preserving, archiving and
                accessibility, this approach tries to outline the ephemerality
                of digitally stored materials. Collective destruction is the way
                to gain access to content that is inherently impermanent.

                Where Germany meets Switzerland and Austria is Lake Constance.
                On its northen borther is Konstanz, the city that held the
                digital arts conference "xCoAx" in July of 2023. The idea of a
                border, so relevant to this place, was the main idea explored
                here: the intersection between countries, as well as the
                convergence between media, art forms and artists, the
                overlapping between creativity and algorithmic rules, the
                exchange of ideas and the connection to the “X factor” that
                connects the three main elements of this conference:
                computation, communication and aesthetics.

                In July of 2022, Coimbra, Portugal served as the host city for
                the xCoAx conference, bringing together participants from around
                the world to share their research, discuss new ideas, and
                showcase innovative digital art projects. Through a series of
                talks, exhibitions and presentations, xCoAx 2022 highlighted the
                importance of interdisciplinary thinking and the role of
                technology in shaping contemporary art and culture. xCoAx's
                visual identity is part of a flexible design system that
                includes variable typography, logo, color palette, patterns, and
                textures. This approach allows for experimentation and a playful
                visual style while maintaining a cohesive and organic graphic
                evolution from year to year.

                The festivity of "Nossa Senhora do Rosário" has been celebrated
                for more than 300 years in Gondomar, Portugal. This celebration
                is the most important tradition in the town. On the first Sunday
                of October, Gondomar transforms from a quiet, dark, and silent
                suburb on the outskirts of Porto into a vibrant hub of
                festivity. The "jewels" (jóias) of the Rosário, which are bright
                and colorful lights, fill the black sky and create an epicenter
                of celebration.

                To immortalize and pay homage to this poorly documented
                Portuguese tradition, a photobook was created, which is the
                result of an analog and digital photographic session that took
                place on the night of October 4th, 2019. The photographic
                spreads are repeatedly invaded by loose typography, which
                reinforces the idea of a multisensory experience intrinsic to
                the festivity. The typography also helps to create a narrative
                that is intimately connected to the personal experience of a
                "Gondomarense" who is an avid participant in the celebration.

                  This project seeks to visually represent a shared media
                  ecology within a shared universe, specifically the
                  transitional space between the domestic and academic
                  environments, the journey between home and university. To
                  achieve this, we chose to focus on the radio as a starting
                  point for the mapping of our media ecology, as it is a
                  technology that is extremely prevalent on car rides. The
                  concept of white noise associated with the radio is also
                  essential to this project as it represents the constant flow
                  of information that surrounds us during the commute.
                  Ultimately, the project functions as an exploration of how
                  technology shapes our experiences and understanding of the
                  world around us. <em>Coded with Processing.</em>

                  The EU's handling of migrants and refugees has been a
                  perpetual failure. As European citizens, we are fed a
                  distorted glimpse of their journeys by the media to avoid the
                  risk of encouraging us to empathize and take real action. We
                  can’t accept their truth and must demand accountability and
                  action. This essay serves as a reminder of what is concealed
                  from us.

                  The scenery depicted in the book was created through our own
                  performance. During the process of crafting this environment,
                  the screen played a prominent role. We captured panoramic
                  shots of a TV screen, resulting in images that emerged from
                  the interplay of two machines. This interaction produced an
                  altered reflection of images from one screen onto another.
                  However, the performative aspect was vital to our essay, as it
                  allows us, the designers, to play an active role. We remain
                  silent to avoid overshadowing the experiences of migrants and
                  refugees, but we are present.
